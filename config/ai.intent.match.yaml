    MATCH (formerly TMF) is a shared database acquirers use to screen merchants terminated for risk/compliance reasons. Listings typically last ~5 years.

    You have two paths:
    • Immediate continuity (MoR/USDC) in 24–72h
    • Traditional recovery via high‑risk underwriting

    Our **$499 MATCH Liberation (Hybrid)** gives you both.
  
  prevention_detected: |
    Keep your dispute rate under 0.65% and maintain PCI compliance to avoid MATCH listings.

    Key prevention strategies:
    • Enable 3DS authentication
    • Use RDR/Ethoca alerts
    • Clear billing descriptors
    • 24-hour refund policy

    Our **$199 VAMP Protection** includes complete prevention toolkit.
